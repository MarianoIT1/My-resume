                I am a proactive and enthusiastic person, passionate about technology and design, and hungry for new knowledge. I was always interested in software development and when I finished high school I studied systems engineering for 3 years.
                <br/><br/>
                Then, life took me down other paths where I successfully started gastronomic businesses, but I never stopped being interested in what I loved.
                <br/><br/>
                I recently decided to start over, I'm finishing a full-stack coding Bootcamp and I want to start developing my career in the world of development and technology.

                When I'm not in front of a computer, I like to go for a walk with Balti üê∂ in the park and meet up with friends for drinks.
